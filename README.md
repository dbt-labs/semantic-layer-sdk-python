# dbt Semantic Layer SDK for Python

> ðŸ§ª This library is still experimental and it's not feature complete yet.

A library for easily accessing [dbt's Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl/) via Python.

## Installation

To install the SDK, you'll need to specify optional dependencies depending on whether you want to use it synchronously (backed by [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/)) or via [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) (backed by [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/)).

```
# Sync installation
pip install dbt-sl-sdk[sync]

# Async installation
pip install dbt-sl-sdk[async]
```

## Usage

To run operations against the Semantic Layer APIs, just instantiate a `SemanticLayerClient` with your specific connection parameters ([learn more](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview)):

```python
from dbtsl import SemanticLayerClient

client = SemanticLayerClient(
    environment_id=123,
    auth_token="<your-semantic-layer-api-token>",
    host="semantic-layer.cloud.getdbt.com",
)

# query the first metric by `metric_time`
def main():
    with client.session():
        metrics = client.metrics()
        table = client.query(
            metrics=[metrics[0].name],
            group_by=["metric_time"],
        )
        print(table)

main()
```

Note that all method calls that will reach out to the APIs need to be within a `client.session()` context manager. By using a session, the client can connect to the APIs only once, and reuse the same connection between API calls.

### asyncio

If you're using asyncio, import `AsyncSemanticLayerClient` from `dbtsl.asyncio`. The APIs of `SemanticLayerClient` and `AsyncSemanticLayerClient` are the same. The only difference is that the asyncio version has `async` methods which need to be `await`ed.

That same sync example can be converted into asyncio code like so:

```python
import asyncio
from dbtsl.asyncio import AsyncSemanticLayerClient

client = AsyncSemanticLayerClient(
    environment_id=123,
    auth_token="<your-semantic-layer-api-token>",
    host="semantic-layer.cloud.getdbt.com",
)

async def main():
    async with client.session():
        metrics = await client.metrics()
        table = await client.query(
            metrics=[metrics[0].name],
            group_by=["metric_time"],
        )
        print(table)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Integrating with dataframe libraries

By design, the SDK returns all query data as [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) tables. If you wish to use the data with libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [polars](https://pola.rs/), you need to manually download them and convert the data into their format.

If you're using pandas:
```python
# ... initialize client

arrow_table = client.query(...)
pandas_df = arrow_table.to_pandas()
```

If you're using polars:
```python
import polars as pl

# ... initialize client

arrow_table = client.query(...)
polars_df = pl.from_arrow(arrow_table)
```

### More examples

Check out our [usage examples](./examples/) to learn more.


### Disabling telemetry

By default, dbt the SDK sends some [platform-related information](./dbtsl/env.py) to dbt Labs. If you'd like to opt out, do
```python
from dbtsl.env import PLATFORM
PLATFORM.anonymous = True

# ... initialize client
```
